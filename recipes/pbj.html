    <h1>Peanut Butter and Jelly</h1>
    <img src="../images/pbj.jpg" width="400">
    <h3>This is little known sandwich. One you may not be familiar with. This one is hard to give the proper credit to. It's like folklore.</h3>
    <p>This is an advanced recipe. It is <i>very</i> hard. Try your best to follow along. It may not turn out on the first try. But don't give up! The key is balance. The ratio between the many ingredients will make or break this dish.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Peanut butter</li>
        <li>Jelly</li>
        <li>Bread</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Slice two pieces of bread. This will serve as the bread to our sandwich.</li>
    <li>One one slice of the bread, evenly spread peanut butter from edge to edge. Instead of your finger, try using a butter knife!</li>
    <li>On the other slice of bread, evenly spread your jelly from edge to edge. This should mirror the previous slice, except on this piece, it's jelly.</li>
    <li>Now comes the tricky part. Take a slice of the bread in each hand. Put them together, being careful to line them up. This "sandwiches" the two pieces together forming a kind of "sandwich."</li>
    <li>Carefully turn your newly created sandwich into two, smaller sandwiches. No, this isn't some sort of magic. Just use the same knife as before to cut it corner to corner so your two smaller sandwiches are triangle shaped. </li>
    <li>If you followed this carefully, it still probably didn't work. That's ok. You're learning! Keep at it, and someday you'll make peanut butter and jelly like a pro.</li>
