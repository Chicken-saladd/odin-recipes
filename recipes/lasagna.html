    <h3>This lasagna recipe is one I stole directly from FOODYSCHMOODY. </h3>
    <p>Once you put together the ingredients listed below in the order and manner described in the directions, you too will have lasagna. It really is that simple!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>32 ounce ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon parsley</li>
        <li>16 ounce lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounce mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>48 ounce pasta sauce</li>
        <li>Fresh basil for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare pasta according to package instructions. Drain and set aside to cool slightly, just enough to be able to handle. </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350.</li>
        <li>Add ricotta, eggs, salt, pepper, parmesan cheese and parsley to a bowl. Stir to combine well.</li>
        <li>Spread about 2 ladles full of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Place 3 noodles, slightly overlapping. Spread an even layer of the ricotta mixture over noodles. Place a few pieces of the freshly cut mozzarella over the ricotta then add another 2 or so ladles full of sauce over that. Repeat layers two or three more times, depending on the depth of your pan. Your ending layer should be noodle, sauce and mozzarella; no ricotta.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 35 minutes, remove foil and bake another 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Once out of the oven, allow to set up for at least 10-15 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>When serving, top each piece with either 1 leaf of basil or a few torn pieces.</li>
        <h5>Enjoy!</h5>
